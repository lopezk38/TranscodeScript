Powershell script designed for chonologically ordering, transcoding, and renaming video clips generated by NVidia Shadowplay from a set of predefined folders.


Dependencies:

	Powershell (Was written for and tested on Powershell 5.1 - Will probably work on other versions)
	
	ffmpeg

Notes:

Each input folder has a predefined time zone attached to them. Clips are assigned a source timezone based upon which folder they are in  
  
The script expects the exact date stamps Shadowplay writes in each clips filename when they are created. Everything else in the filename can be changed.  
  
It currently expects .mp4 input files. It currently outputs DNXHD 1080p 59.94 FPS .mov files.  
  
Giving an input file the name 0 will force it retain the name 0. There can only be one, and it only works for 0, not for any number.  
  
	
	
Basic description of how it works:  
The script loops through a set of predefined folders. Each of those folders has a pre programmed timezone. It looks in each of these folders, uses regex
to parse the timestamp in the file name, from year all the way down to second, and stores it. It will then modifiy the stored time based upon what
timezone folder the clip came from - it converts everything to Pacific time. It then attempts to rename the clip to a new date stamp format, losing all
other data that may have been stored in the file name. The format is YYYY.MM.DD.HH.MM.SS.DUPECOUNT. The dupecount is used to prevent overwriting other
clips that may have been recorded in the exact same second - It starts at 00 and increases by 1 every time it fails to rename the file, up to 25. If
it hits 25, it skips that clip and beeps angrily. It then copys the renamed clip to a new predefined directory. Once it finishes renaming and copying
clips, it will give you a summary of how many clips it succeded in renaming out of the total amount and pause for 5 seconds. If there were errors, it
will print out the names of the failed clips and wait an additional 10 seconds so you have time to read them. It will then send all the newly copied
and renamed clips through ffmpeg by order of oldest to newest based off of the file name. It enumerates all the clips so that the oldest file is 1,
increasing by 1 for each subsequent file. If there was a file named 0, it will be given the enumeration 0 - This will not cause a gap in enumeration.
The outputted files are stored in another predefined folder (All predefined folders are meant to be on different drives for maximum throughput, but they
don't need to be) and then renamed to their enumerated value. The script will then beep happily, and exit
